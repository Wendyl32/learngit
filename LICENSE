In the fen, something like a woman balances on something resembling a tree. 
The sky above it is wispy with feathers of birds migrating to nowhere, and down by the water their heads become temporarily dislodged.

The horizon is shaded in static purple, and I can see it all. Everything is real and original. 
Everything has gone to hell, and this rock seems to be my faraday cage. 
I can't be sure of what I am anymore.

Am I the only one still capable of being afraid? I could be the only one waiting for the singularity. 
Everything else is indifferent. 
The rats have been multiplying for ages, but it shouldn't be long now.

The year is 3053, and I've seen it all.

Let's begin at the end.
