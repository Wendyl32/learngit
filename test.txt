We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! 
How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again. 
Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction, no further compromise shall we allow. 
We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock.
